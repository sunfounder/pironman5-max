1. What Else Should We Prepare?
===================================

**Essential Components**

* Raspberry Pi 5 

    The Pironman 5 is fully compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5.

.. * 5V/5A Power Adapter

..     A 5V/5A power adapter is required to power the Pironman 5 and its components.

* Micro SD Card
 
    It is recommended to use an SD card with a minimum of 16GB of storage for Raspberry Pi OS. For Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a minimum of 4GB is advised.

**Optional Components**

* 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch SATA Drives

    The Pironman 5 NAS supports optional storage expansion through one or two 3.5-inch SATA or 2.5-inch drives. This flexible configuration allows users to enhance their storage capacity using standard hard drives or SSDs, making it ideal for data-heavy applications or media storage setups.

* SSD Drives 

    The Pironman 5 NAS supports optional storage expansion through one or two SSD drives. This flexible configuration allows users to enhance their storage capacity using high-speed SSDs, making it ideal for data-intensive applications or media storage setups.

* Screen

    To access the Raspberry Pi's desktop environment, a screen such as a TV or a computer monitor is required.
    
* HDMI Cable

    The Raspberry Pi 5's HDMI ports have been adapted to standard HDMI Type A interfaces via a USB HDMI adapter. Therefore, a standard HDMI to HDMI cable is needed to connect the Pironman 5 to a display.

* Mouse & Keyboard

    Any USB port on the Pironman 5 can be used to connect a wired keyboard and mouse, or a USB Bluetooth receiver for wireless peripherals.
